# Galaxy Team Internal App - Simplified Explainer Document

## Executive Summary

The Galaxy Team Internal App is a streamlined mobile platform built with Expo and Supabase that connects your 3,000+ members with leadership through simple, effective tools. The app focuses on clear communication, basic content quality checks, and personal performance tracking. All heavy analytics and processing happen in your central ERP system - the app serves as a clean, focused interface for daily member activities.

### The Solution
A lightweight mobile app that:
- Delivers content ideas with leader guidance
